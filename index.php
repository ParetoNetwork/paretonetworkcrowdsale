This Agreement constitutes a legal, valid, and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors&rsquo; rights generally and general principles of equity. To the knowledge of the Company, it is not in violation of </span></p>
<p><span>(i)&nbsp;its current certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or </span></p>
<p><span>(ii)&nbsp;any material indenture or contract to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound, where, in each case, such violation, individually, or together with all such violations, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.</span>
  <span>To the knowledge of the Company, the performance and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement do not and will not: (i)&nbsp;violate any material judgment, statute, rule, or regulation applicable to the Company as currently in effect; (ii)&nbsp;result in the acceleration of any material indenture or contract to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound; or (iii)&nbsp;result in the creation or imposition of any lien upon any property, asset, or revenue of the Company or the suspension, forfeiture, or nonrenewal of any material permit, license, or authorization applicable to the Company, its business, or its operations.</span>

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, THE PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS NOT RELIED UPON ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE BY THE COMPANY, OR ANY OTHER PERSON ON THE COMPANY'S BEHALF.</span>
</p>
<span><strong>Purchaser Representations and Agreements </strong></span>
<p><span>The Purchaser has full legal capacity, power, and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. This Agreement constitutes valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors&rsquo; rights generally and general principles of equity.</span>
  <span>The Purchaser is entering into this Agreement to acquire the Tokens for its own account, not as a nominee or agent, with the sole intention of using the Tokens to post and/or acquire information on the Network and otherwise to access the functions of the Network, and, except as is consistent with the foregoing, the Purchaser has no current intention of selling, granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the Tokens. The Purchaser has such knowledge and experience regarding computer science (and in particular blockchain technology) and financial and business matters that the Purchaser is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of purchasing, holding, and using the Tokens, and understands that the Network Launch may never occur and, in that event, Tokens will not be created or delivered to the Purchaser, and even if the Tokens are created and transferred to the Purchaser, the value to the Purchaser of using a Token on the Network, to access information on the Network or otherwise, may be less than the Purchase Price Per Token paid by the Purchaser under this Agreement. In addition, the Purchaser understands that the Company is under no obligation to achieve a Network Launch prior to the expiration or termination of this Agreement, or at all, and that no portion of the Total Purchase Amount will be returned to the Purchaser if this Agreement expires or is terminated prior to the occurrence of a Network Launch.</span>
<span>The Purchaser has read the Whitepaper, is aware of the anticipated features and design of the Network, and acknowledges that there are a variety of reasons why the Network Launch may not occur or the Network as launched may differ from its description in the Whitepaper. The Purchaser acknowledges that the Whitepaper is necessarily only a summary description of certain anticipated features of the Network and may omit discussion of features that are material to its function and/or success. The Purchaser has acquired sufficient information about the Network and its anticipated development by the Company to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to enter into this Agreement. The Purchaser understands that the Tokens involve risks, all of which the Purchaser fully and completely assumes, including, but not limited to, the risk that </span></p>
<p><span>(i)&nbsp;the technology associated with the Network will not function as intended; </span></p>
<p><span>(ii)&nbsp;the Network and Network Launch will not be completed; </span></p>
<p><span>(iii) the Network will fail to attract sufficient interest from key participants; and</span></p>
<p><span> (iv) the Company and/or the Network may be subject to investigation and punitive actions from Governmental Authorities. The Purchaser understands and expressly accepts that the Tokens will be created and delivered to the Purchaser at the sole risk of the Purchaser on an &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; and &ldquo;UNDER DEVELOPMENT&rdquo; basis. The Purchaser understands and expressly accepts that the Purchaser has not relied on any representations or warranties made by the Company outside of this Agreement and, subject to the foregoing, the Whitepaper, including, but not limited to, conversations of any kind, whether through oral or electronic communication. </span></p>
<p><span>WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, THE PURCHASER ASSUMES ALL RISK AND LIABILITY FOR THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY THE USE OF ANY TOKENS AND REGARDLESS OF ANY ORAL OR WRITTEN STATEMENTS MADE BY THE COMPANY, BY WAY OF TECHNICAL ADVICE OR OTHERWISE, RELATED TO THE USE OF THE TOKENS.</span>
</p>
<p><span>The Purchaser understands that the Purchaser has no right against the Company or any other Person except in the event of the Company&rsquo;s breach of this Agreement or intentional fraud. </span></p>
<p><span>THE COMPANY&rsquo;S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL OF THE AMOUNTS PAID TO THE COMPANY PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT. NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR ITS REPRESENTATIVES SHALL BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR ENHANCED DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT.</span>
</p>
<p><span>The Purchaser understands that the Purchaser bears sole responsibility for any taxes as a result of the matters and transactions the subject of this Agreement, and any future acquisition, ownership, use, sale, or other disposition of Tokens held by the Purchaser. To the extent permitted by law, the Purchaser agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the Company and each of its affiliates, employees, and agents (including developers, auditors, contractors, and founders) harmless for any claim, liability, assessment, or penalty with respect to any taxes (other than any net income taxes of the Company that result from the transfer of Tokens to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 1(a)) associated with or arising from the Purchaser&rsquo;s purchase of Tokens hereunder, or the use or ownership of Pareto Tokens by the Purchaser or any other Person.</span>
<span>The Purchaser </span></p>
<p><span>(i)&nbsp;is not deemed under or by this Agreement to hold any capital stock of or any other equity interest in the Company and </span></p>
<p><span>(ii)&nbsp;is not entitled under or by this Agreement to acquire, vote, or receive dividends in respect of the capital stock of or any other equity interest in of the Company. </span></p>
<p><span>Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to confer on the Purchaser, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action or to receive notice of meetings, or to receive subscription rights or otherwise.</span>
</p>
<span>Procedures for Purchase of Tokens and Valuation of Purchase Amount </span>
<span>The Company will accept payment for the Tokens purchased under this Agreement in Ether, and Bitcoin. The Purchaser shall make the required payment to the Company in consideration for the Purchaser&rsquo;s purchase of the Tokens pursuant to this Agreement through the procedures separately set forth by the Company.</span>
<span>For purposes of this Agreement, the value of the Purchase Amount shall be deemed in U.S. dollars notwithstanding the Purchaser&rsquo;s payment in Ether or Bitcoin, valued at the Applicable Exchange Rate. The term &ldquo;<strong><em>Applicable Exchange Rate</em></strong>&rdquo; shall mean the volume-weighted average daily price of Ether or Bitcoin across exchanges at the end of the business day preceding the Effective Date.</span>
<span>Each of the Company and the Purchaser agree that this Agreement constitutes a &ldquo;forward contract&rdquo; for the acquisition of a commodity for all relevant purposes, including U.S. federal, state, and local income tax purposes, and will not take any position on any tax return, report, statement, or other tax document that is inconsistent with such treatment, unless otherwise required by a change in law occurring after the Effective Date, a closing agreement with an applicable tax authority, or a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.</span>

  <span>The Company shall not be liable or responsible to the Purchaser, nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term of this Agreement when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from acts beyond the Company&rsquo;s reasonable control, including, without limitation: (i) acts of God; (ii) flood, fire, earthquake, or explosion; (iii) war, invasion, hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, or other civil unrest; (iv) applicable Law; or (v) action by any Governmental Authority.</span>
